# RayMarching
A C++ Ray Marching Demo

This C++ project runs 2D ray-marching. A set of walls are defined in Walls, to be defined within the bounds of the scene.
Every Wall has a position (top left corner) and a scale (the size of the wall).
The mouse can be moved around in the scene to move the camera, which will in turn move the source of ray-marching, highlighting different parts of the scene.
